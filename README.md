## About Me

I'm a cloud architect and entrepreneur building end-to-end software solutions. Based in Groningen, I combine deep technical expertise in Python, Google Cloud Platform, and mobile development with a business-focused consultancy mindset.

**What sets me apart:** I use AI tools (Gemini, Claude) strategically to achieve 3-5x productivity while maintaining full architectural control and enterprise-grade code quality.

## AI-Augmented Development

I work with AI as a force multiplier: I'm the architect, AI is my junior developer.

- **I handle:** Architecture, security patterns, business logic, code review
- **AI handles:** Boilerplate, tests, documentation, initial implementations
- **Result:** 3-5x productivity without sacrificing quality

This workflow enables me to build and maintain complex multi-tenant SaaS systems solo.
