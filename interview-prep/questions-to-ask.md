## Questions NOT to Ask

Avoid these questions, or phrase them differently:

| Don't Ask | Better Alternative |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "What's the salary?" | Ask HR in a separate conversation |
| "Did I get the job?" | "What are the next steps?" |
| "Is there lots of overtime?" | "What are typical work hours?" |
| "Why is this position open?" | (This is actually OK to ask) |
| "Do you like working here?" | Too informal, ask about culture instead |

## Tips for Asking Questions

1. **Listen first** - Many of your questions may be answered naturally
2. **Take notes** - Write down questions during the interview
3. **Be authentic** - Ask questions you genuinely care about
4. **Read the room** - If time is short, prioritize your top 2-3
5. **Follow up** - If they give an interesting answer, ask a follow-up question

## Your Goal

By the end of the interview, you want them to think:

> "This person is engaged, thoughtful, and genuinely interested in our company. They asked questions that showed deep technical understanding and strategic thinking."

Good questions demonstrate that you're **evaluating them** as much as they're evaluating you. This confidence and selectivity is attractive to employers.
